    <p class="t_indent line_height">Raigad, seen in the Raigad district of Maharashtra, India, is a hill fort located in the city of
        Mahad. It is one of the strongest fortresses on the Deccan Plateau and was historically referred to as Rairee or
        Rairy fort.[1]

        Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, the Maratha ruler, along with his chief engineer Hiroji Indulkar, did the
        construction and development of various buildings and structures, including Raigad. In 1674, after being crowned
        the king of the Maratha Kingdom of the Konkan, Shivaji Maharaj chose Raigad as the capital of his Hindavi
        Swaraj.[2]</p>
    <p class="t_indent line_height">
        Located at an elevation of 820 metres (2,700 ft) above its base and 1,356 m (4,449 ft) above sea level within
        the Sahyadri mountain range, the fort offers views of the surrounding area. The fort was home to around 1,550
        people having an average family size of 5 people. Accessing the fort requires ascending approximately 1,737
        steps. Alternatively, visitors can opt for the Raigad Ropeway, an aerial tramway spanning 750 m (2,460 ft) in
        length and reaching a height of 400 m (1,300 ft), which conveniently transports them from the ground to the fort
        in just four minutes.

        The main palace was constructed using wood, of which only the base pillars remain. The main fort ruins consist
        of the queen's quarters, and six chambers, with each chamber having its private restroom. The chambers do not
        have any windows. In addition, ruins of three watch towers can be seen directly in front of the palace grounds
        out of which only two remain as the third one was destroyed during a bombardment. The fort also overlooks an
        artificial lake known as the Ganga Sagar Lake.[3]

        The only main pathway to the fort passes through the "Maha Darwaja" (Great Door) which was previously closed at
        sunset. The Maha Darwaja has two huge bastions on both sides of the door which are approximately 20–21 m (65–70
        ft) in height. The top of the fort is 180 m (600 ft) above this door.
